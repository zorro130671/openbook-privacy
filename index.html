<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date: January 20, 2026</strong></p>

<p>OpenBook ("we," "us," or "our") operates the OpenBook mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our App.</p>

<p>By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>We collect the following types of information:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Account Information</strong>: When you create an account, we collect your email address (used for login and account recovery via Firebase Authentication).</li>
    <li><strong>User Content</strong>: Text messages, media files (images, videos, etc.) that you send or receive in chats. These are stored on our servers to enable messaging functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>Device and Usage Information</strong>: Automatically collected data such as device type, operating system version, IP address, app version, crash logs, and usage patterns (e.g., session duration). This may include data from Firebase services like Crashlytics or Analytics (if enabled).</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase-Related Data</strong>: Firebase Authentication collects your email, IP address, user agent, and other technical data for authentication. Firebase Storage/Database handles your messages/media.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not collect phone numbers, location data, contacts, camera/microphone access (beyond user-initiated media upload), or any other personal information unless explicitly provided by you in messages.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

<p>We use the collected information to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the App's chat functionality (e.g., deliver messages, store media).</li>
    <li>Authenticate your account and enable login/recovery.</li>
    <li>Detect crashes, bugs, and performance issues to improve stability.</li>
    <li>Respond to support requests or communications with you.</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>

<p>We do not sell your personal information. We share data only as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>With Google/Firebase</strong>: Your data (including email, messages, media, device info) is processed and stored by Google LLC through Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore/Realtime Database, Storage, etc.). Google acts as our data processor. See Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: If required by law, court order, or to protect rights/safety.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: Limited to trusted providers who help operate the App (under strict confidentiality).</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

<p>Your data is stored on secure Firebase servers (Google Cloud). We use industry-standard security measures (encryption in transit, access controls). Messages/media are retained as long as needed to provide the service or until you delete them/your account. Crash/usage data is kept for limited periods per Firebase policies.</p>

<p>Note: Messages are not end-to-end encrypted by default (Firebase does not provide this out-of-the-box). If you enable encryption features later, we will update this policy.</p>

<h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>

<p>You may:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Request access to, correction of, or deletion of your data by emailing us at <a href="mailto:zah@mac.com">zah@mac.com</a>.</li>
    <li>Delete your account within the App (this removes your messages/media where possible).</li>
    <li>Opt out of analytics/crash reporting if we provide settings (check App settings).</li>
</ul>

<p>We respond to verifiable requests in accordance with applicable laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA if relevant).</p>

<h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>The App is not intended for children under 13 (or 16 in some regions). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we learn we have, we will delete it.</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy. Changes will be posted here with an updated effective date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
